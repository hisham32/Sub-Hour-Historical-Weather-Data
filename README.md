# Sub-hourly historical weather data with DarkSky API

Hacky way to collect sub-hourly (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 30 mins) weather data from : https://darksky.net/dev, API request formats: https://darksky.net/dev/docs.
Dark Sky has recently joined Apple, so new registration to collect API key is no longer available. However, previously collected API keys can be used to collect weather data upto 2021. Some API keys are shared in the Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to use them!
